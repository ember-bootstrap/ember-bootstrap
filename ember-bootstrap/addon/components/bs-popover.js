/**
  Component that implements Bootstrap [popovers](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers).

  By default, it will attach its listeners (click) to the parent DOM element to trigger
  the popover:

  ```hbs
  <button class="btn">
    <BsPopover @title="this is a title">and this the body</BsPopover>
  </button>
  ```

  ### Trigger

  The trigger element is the DOM element that will cause the popover to be shown when one of the trigger events occur on
  that element. By default, the trigger element is the parent DOM element of the component, and the trigger event will be
  "click".

  The `triggerElement` property accepts any CSS selector to attach the popover to any other existing DOM element.

  To customize the events that will trigger the popover use the `triggerEvents` property, that accepts an array or a
  string of events, with "hover", "focus" and "click" being supported.

  ### Placement options

  By default, the popover will show up to the right of the trigger element. Use the `placement` property to change that
  ("top", "bottom", "left" and "right"). To make sure the popover will not exceed the viewport (see Advanced customization)
  you can set `autoPlacement` to true. A popover with `placement="right" will be placed to the right if there is enough
  space, otherwise to the left.

  ### Advanced customization

  Several other properties allow for some advanced customization:
  * `visible` to show/hide the popover programmatically
  * `fade` to disable the fade in transition
  * `delay` (or `delayShow` and `delayHide`) to add a delay
  * `viewportSelector` and `viewportPadding` to customize the viewport that affects `autoPlacement`
  *  a `close` action is yielded, that allows you to close the tooltip:

  ```hbs
  <BsPopover as |po| >This is a popover <button {{on "click" po.close}}>Close</button></BsPopover>
  ```

  See the individual API docs for each property.

  ### Actions

  When you want to react on the popover being shown or hidden, you can use one of the following supported actions:
  * `onShow`
  * `onShown`
  * `onHide`
  * `onHidden`

  *Note that only invoking the component in a template as shown above is considered part of its public API. Extending from it (subclassing) is generally not supported, and may break at any time.*
