/**
 Component that implements Bootstrap [tooltips](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips).

 By default it will attach its listeners (mouseover and focus) to the parent DOM element to trigger
 the tooltip:

 ```hbs
 <button class="btn">
   {{bs-tooltip title="This is a tooltip"}}
 </button>
 ```

 You can also use the component in a block form to set the title:

 ```hbs
 <button class="btn">
   {{#bs-tooltip}}This is a tooltip{{/bs-tooltip}}
 </button>
 ```

 ### Trigger

 The trigger element is the DOM element that will cause the tooltip to be shown when one of the trigger events occur on
 that element. By default the trigger element is the parent DOM element of the component, and the trigger events will be
 "hover" and "focus".

 The `triggerElement` property accepts any CSS selector to attach the tooltip to any other existing DOM element.
 With the special value "parentView" you can attach the tooltip to the DOM element of the parent component:

 ```hbs
 {{#my-component}}
   {{bs-tooltip title="This is a tooltip" triggerElement="parentView"}}
 {{/my-component}}
 ```

 To customize the events that will trigger the tooltip use the `triggerEvents` property, that accepts an array or a
 string of events, with "hover", "focus" and "click" being supported.

 ### Placement options

 By default the tooltip will show up on top of the trigger element. Use the `placement` property to change that
 ("top", "bottom", "left" and "right"). To make sure the tooltip will not exceed the viewport (see Advanced customization)
 you can set `autoPlacement` to true. A tooltip with `placement="right" will be placed to the right if there is enough
 space, otherwise to the left.

 ### Advanced customization

 Several other properties allow for some advanced customization:
 * `visible` to show/hide the tooltip programmatically
 * `fade` to disable the fade in transition
 * `delay` (or `delayShow` and `delayHide`) to add a delay
 * `viewportSelector` and `viewportPadding` to customize the viewport that affects `autoPlacement`

 See the individual API docs for each property.

 ### Actions

 When you want to react on the tooltip being shown or hidden, you can use one of the following supported actions:
 * `onShow`
 * `onShown`
 * `onHide`
 * `onHidden`

 @class Tooltip
 @namespace Components
 @extends Components.ContextualHelp
 @public
 */
export default ContextualHelp.extend({
  layout,

  /**
   * The DOM element of the arrow element.
   *
   * @property arrowElement
   * @type object
   * @readonly
   * @private
   */
  arrowElement: computed('overlayElement', function() {
    return this.get('overlayElement').querySelector('.tooltip-arrow');
  }).volatile()
});
