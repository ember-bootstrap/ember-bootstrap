/**
  Render a form with the appropriate Bootstrap layout class (see `formLayout`).
  Allows setting a `model` that nested `Components.FormElement`s can access, and that can provide form validation (see below)

  You can use whatever markup you like within the form.
  However, to benefit from features such as automatic form markup, validations and validation markup, use `Components.FormElement`
  as nested components. See below for an example.

  ### Submitting the form

  The form yields a `submitButton` component, which is a preconfigured `<BsButton>` with `@type="primary"` and `type="submit"`.
  The button is disabled while a form submission is pending. Additionally, the button state is bound to the form submission state.

  ```hbs
  <BsForm as |form|>
    <form.submitButton>Submit</form.submitButton>
  </BsForm>
  ```

  When the form is submitted (e.g. by clicking the submit button), the event will be intercepted and the `onSubmit` action
  will be sent to the controller or parent component.
  In case the form supports validation (see "Form validation" below), the `onBefore` action is called (which allows you to
  do e.g. model data normalization), then the available validation rules are evaluated, and if those fail, the `onInvalid`
  action is sent instead of `onSubmit`.

  ### Use with Components.FormElement

  When using `Components.FormElement`s with their `property` set to property names of the form's validation enabled
  `model`, you gain some additional powerful features:
  * the appropriate Bootstrap markup for the given `formLayout` and the form element's `controlType` is automatically generated
  * markup for validation states and error messages is generated based on the model's validation (if available), when submitting the form
  with an invalid validation, or when focusing out of invalid inputs

  ```handlebars
  <BsForm @formLayout="horizontal" @model={{this}} @onSubmit={{action "submit"}} as |form|>
    <form.element @controlType="email" @label="Email" @placeholder="Email" @property="email" />
    <form.element @controlType="password" @label="Password" @placeholder="Password" @property="password" />
    <form.element @controlType="checkbox" @label="Remember me" @property="rememberMe" />
    <form.submitButton>Submit</form.submitButton>
  </BsForm>
  ```

  See the [Components.FormElement](Components.FormElement.html) API docs for further information.

  ### Form validation

  All version of ember-bootstrap beginning from 0.7.0 do not come with built-in support for validation engines anymore.
  Instead, support is added usually by additional Ember addons, for example:

  * [ember-bootstrap-validations](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap-validations): adds support for [ember-validations](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-validations)
  * [ember-bootstrap-cp-validations](https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-bootstrap-cp-validations): adds support for [ember-cp-validations](https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-cp-validations)
  * [ember-bootstrap-changeset-validations](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap-changeset-validations): adds support for [ember-changeset](https://github.com/poteto/ember-changeset)

  To add your own validation support, you have to:

  * extend this component, setting `hasValidator` to true if validations are available (by means of a computed property for example), and implementing the `validate` method
  * extend the [Components.FormElement](Components.FormElement.html) component and implement the `setupValidations` hook or simply override the `errors` property to add the validation error messages to be displayed

  When validation fails, the appropriate Bootstrap markup is added automatically, i.e. the error classes are applied and
  the validation messages are shown for each form element. In case the validation library supports it, also warning messages
  are shown. See the [Components.FormElement](Components.FormElement.html) documentation for further details.

  See the above-mentioned addons for examples.

  The `novalidate` HTML attribute is set by default for forms that have validation.

  ### Submission state

  A `isSubmitting` property is yielded, which is `true` after submit has been triggered and before the Promise returned
  by `onSubmit` is fulfilled. It could be used to show a loading spinner instead of the form while it's submitting for example:

  ```hbs
  <BsForm @onSubmit={{action "save"}} as |form|>
    {{#if form.isSubmitting}}
      <span class="spinner-border spinner-border-sm" role="status" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      Logging in...
    {{else}}
      <form.element @property="email" @label="email" />
      <form.element @property="password" @label="password" @controlType="password" />
      <form.submitButton>Login</form.submitButton>
    {{/if}}
  </BsForm>
  ```

  Additionaly `isSubmitted` and `isRejected` properties are yielded. `isSubmitted` is `true` if last submission was successful.
  `isRejected` is `true` if last submission was rejected due to validation errors or by an action bound to `onSubmit` event, returning a rejected promise.
  It could be used for visual feedback about last submission:

  ```hbs
  <BsForm @onSubmit={{action 'save}} as |form|>
    <form.submitButton @type={{if form.isRejected "danger" "primary"}}>
      Save
    </form.submitButton>
  </BsForm>
  ```

  The submission state is reset as soon as any value of a form element changes. Additionally, it can be reset programmatically by
  calling the yielded `resetSubmissionState` function.

  *Note that only invoking the component in a template as shown above is considered part of its public API. Extending from it (subclassing) is generally not supported, and may break at any time.*
