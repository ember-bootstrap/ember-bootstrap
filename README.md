An [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com) addon for using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) in Ember applications.

The addon includes the Bootstrap assets (CSS, Icons) in your project (can be disabled). On top of that, it provides a set of native Ember components (no use of Bootstrap JavaScript!).</p>

*See [kaliber5.github.io/ember-bootstrap/](http://kaliber5.github.io/ember-bootstrap/) for full documentation.*

## Install in ember-cli application

In your application's directory:

    ember install ember-bootstrap
    
### 1.0 alpha
    
The 1.0 release is currently in alpha stage. While the API is not guaranteed to remain unchanged until the first stable release, 
breaking changes are unlikely. So I encourage everybody to use the alpha version for new projects, and also to upgrade existing projects:
    
    ember install ember-bootstrap@1.0.0-alpha    
    
The 1.0 release will consist of a number of breaking changes compared to the previous 0.x releases, so be sure to check the 
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details. After the first stable 1.0 release the API should remain stable according to SemVer.    

Beginning from version 1.0 ember-bootstrap will require at least Ember 2.3! Please file any issues you may encounter!

## Updates

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the list of all changes.
